# PoCN_project
Report of the final project for the Physics of Complex Networks course.


Projects: 
Motter-Lai Model [number=14, score=0.4]: Cascade Failure: Cascade Failures are of big importance at the momento to study networks attacks. In this projects we present how fragil can be a network to attacks depending in their degree ditribution (homogeneous or heterogenous). Aditionally we study this phenomenon in real-world cases. 

Language competition dynamics [number =29, score=0.4]: Languages have been created and exciting over the centuries. We can study these dynamics from a competitve perspective as is proposed by H. Strogatz and M. Abrams. With this knowledge we can prevent the extintion of languages with low practice as it can be native languages in marginal communities. 

Public transport in large cities worldwide [number=41, score=1.2]: Dataset obtained from CityLines, which is an open database that contains the transport information of more than 200 cities. Our objective is to create 2 CSV files that contains the nodes and edges created from the public transportation information.
